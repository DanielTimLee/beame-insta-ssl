Hi.

Currently, you have no certificates. You must have at least one
certificate to operate a tunnel.

Here are the steps to obtain SSL certificate from Beame.io:

* Visit %TEMPLATE_STR%/insta-ssl
* Get email with further instructions
* Run the command mentioned in the instructions
* Run "beame-insta-ssl" without any arguments for instructions
